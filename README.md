# Chinese Zodiac Clock

A clock based on the Chinese zodiac and cyclical time.

This project is an experiment with time, symbols and perception.
It explores time and the calendar as a repeating system rather than a linear sequence.  
Instead of counting forward, the clock moves through symbolic cycles, using continuous motion to visualise time as something that returns rather than progresses.

## Concept
The Chinese zodiac describes time as a cycle of recurring signs rather than a numbered timeline.  
This clock translates that idea into a continuously evolving visual system, where change is gradual and cyclical rather than discrete.

## Implementation
The project is built as a small web-based system using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
All logic runs client-side and requires no external dependencies.
